And then you can show that all terms $a_{i,k}$ where k is held for each column will have squared terms for all 'i' in 'n'. Then every other term will have 2 of every term and on top of that there will always be a set of terms that satisfy ($\\sum_i x_{i,k}x_{i,j}$ for every 'k'th and 'j'th  element in 'b' that isn't equal to some element 'm' in $\\vec{b}$.
