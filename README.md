# BlogPosts
Blog-like posts to help solidfy understanding of mathematical underpinnings of machine learning techniques as well as help other people that are trying to self-learn or just looking for another resource to grasp the concepts.

I'm open to suggestions on potentially changing somethings about my future posts. Just make a pull request and I'll review and we can have a discussion through that interface.

Post #1: Regression - IN PROGRESS (Current notebook needs work - don't judge just yet) - to be posted TBD

Outline-
(1) Simple Regression
(2) Multiple
(3) Significance Testing
(4) Subset Selection / Regularization
(5) Non linear extensions (splines / polynomials)
(6) Bias and Variance trade off and how it relates to models found in (1), (2), (4) and (5)


Possible Themes: - Write down an outline for these. Put in 3 things of stuff I've already written that should go in each and 3 things that shouldn't - and then stuff that needs to be addded
Demystifying ML (1) Intro part (2) Non linear extensions (3) Signficance testing ...Need to add: (1) Current ML techniques (2) Discussion of ML's limitations

reducing complexity or increasing complexity - pros and cons complexity vs simplicty (1) Significance testing (2) Subset Selection / Regularization (3) Non linear extensions ...Need to add: (1) More techniques to compare and discuss complexity (2) discussion on available on having enougn / the right data to make certain complex models make sense

significance testing - how do we know if the model we choose are valid or not? (1) Significance testing (2) subset selection / regularization (3) Non linear extensions ...Need to add: (1) Table of signficance tests (start from ISL) (2) In depth discussion on p-values (3) How this is used in real applications / how this relates to the most current ML techniques


Mathematical validity between regression vs  deep learning (deep dive into P value and more into Deep Learning) (1)Significance Testing (2) Non linear extensions (splines / polynomials) (3) Bias and Variance ...Need to add: (1) Deep learning overview and motivations (2) Comparison of pros and cons on deep learning vs other simpler techniques and situations where each one is better or worse.
