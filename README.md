# BlogPosts
Blog-like posts to help solidfy understanding of mathematical underpinnings of machine learning techniques as well as help other people that are trying to self-learn or just looking for another resource to grasp the concepts.

I'm open to suggestions on potentially changing somethings about my future posts. Just make a pull request and I'll review and we can have a discussion through that interface.

Overview: (Any post with a link below is viewable, content has been reviewed, some things need editing or need to be filled in but for the most part content is solid. Anything not listed below - proceed with caution)
