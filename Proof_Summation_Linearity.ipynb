    "# This document is just to quickly show why summations are linear\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous conditions that one can check to see if a function is linear. From some research online these are a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) If there exists only one real or complex solution of 𝑓(𝑥)+𝑎f(x)+a for all real 𝑎a.\n",
    "(2) If 𝑓(𝑎+𝑏)=𝑓(𝑎)+𝑓(𝑏)f(a+b)=f(a)+f(b) for all real 𝑎,𝑏a,b, and if 𝑐𝑓(𝑥)=𝑓(𝑐𝑥)cf(x)=f(cx) for all real 𝑐c.\n",
    "(3) If the second derivative is 00.\n",
    "(4) If the first derivative is constant.\n",
    "(5) If there exist real numbers 𝑎,𝑏a,b such that 𝑓(𝑥)−(𝑎𝑥+𝑏)=0f(x)−(ax+b)=0 for all 𝑥x.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm most familiar with (2) and will use this method. (Caveat: I think this covers the general case of summations if not I will need to revise, but I think this is a at least a good toy example that gets us on our way)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take any summation $$f(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_{i}$$ where $x_i$ could be any aribitrary expression. Thus we need to show 2 things:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) $ f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$\n",
    "(2) $ f(ax) = af(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) $ f(x + y) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} (x + y)_{i} = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_{i} + y_{i}$ (TODO: Interesting tidbit here, since we are seperating the term (x+y) here already, this might already be implying we're assuming that addition is linear and thus summation is just a bunch of additions which then should also be linear. Wonder if that's just enough?)\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_{i} + y_{i} = (x_{0}) + y_{0}) + ... + (x_{n}) + y_{n}) = (x_{0} + ... + x_{n}) + (y_{0} + ... + y_{n})$  Just rearranging terms in the last step.\n",
    "\n",
    "$(x_{0} + ... + x_{n}) + (y_{0} + ... + y_{n}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i + \\sum_{i=0}^{n} y_i$ Thus the first condition is shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) $f(ax) = a(fx)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(ax) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} (ax)_{i} = ax_0 + ... + ax_n = a(x_0 + ... + x_n)$ just expanding and factoring out the constant\n",
    "\n",
    "$a(x_0 + ... + x_n) = a \\sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i = af(x)$. Thus both linearity conditions are met and thus summations are linear."
